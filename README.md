To use this calculator, you need to have a C compiler installed on your computer. The code has been tested on GCC and should work on other compilers as well.

# Prerequisites-
* A C compiler (GCC, Clang, Visual Studio, etc.)
* A text editor (Sublime, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

# Installing-
Clone the repository using the following command:

# Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shahin-m-hashim/SMART-CALCULATOR.git
Alternatively, you can download the code as a zip file and extract it to a local directory in your system.

# Running the code
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located. Run the following commands to compile and execute the code:

<h4> ON WINDOWS Machines </h4> 
* To compile the .c file and generate exe file: gcc -o program_name.exe program_name.c (to compile the .c file and generate exe file)
* To execute the .exe file: cmd /c program_name.exe

<h4> On Linux and Mac Machines </h4>
* To compile the .c file and generate an executable file: gcc -o program_name program_name.c
* To execute the executable file: ./program_name
